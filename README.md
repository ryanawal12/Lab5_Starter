### Check Your Understanding

1) **Testing the "Message" Feature**  
   I wouldn't use a unit test for the "message" feature in a messaging app. This is because sending a message usually involves more than just one piece of code. It often includes interacting with the user interface, backend servers, and databases, making it a more complex, integrated process. This kind of testing is better suited for **integration tests** or **end-to-end tests**, which check how different parts of the application work together.

2) **Testing the "Max Message Length" Feature**  
   I **would** use a unit test for the "max message length" feature, though. This is a straightforward piece of logic that can be tested in isolation. You just need to make sure the function correctly limits the length of a message to 80 characters, which can be done without worrying about the broader context of the app.
